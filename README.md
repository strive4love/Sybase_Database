# bcp
bcp provides a convenient and high-speed method for transferring data between a database table or view and an operating system file. bcp can read or write files in a wide variety of formats. When copying in from a file, bcp inserts data into an existing database table; when copying out to a file, bcp overwrites any previous contents of the file. The utility is located in:
(UNIX) $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/bin/bcp  
(UNIX) $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/bin/bcp_r(for parallel bcp)  
(Windows) %SYBASE%\%SYBASE_OCS%\bin\bcp.exe
